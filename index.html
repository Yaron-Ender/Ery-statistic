  <h2>inroduction:</h2>
  <p>During Erythromycin manufacuring process the substance has been divided into 6 storage container (Bulk batch) that represent different place in the origin container.Assay determination test has been performed to every batch (<em><B>spesification 1.95 - 2.30</B> </em>).this report examine the posability of reducing assay test based on repeatibilty and variance analysis by using inferential statistic</p>
  <span>All the culcolations has been made by minitab software</span>

<h3>3. ANOVA one-way test</h3>
<p>ANOVA one-way tests were performed at a 99% confidence level on all six mean replicates to examine if there is a relationship between them. The null hypothesis stated that there is no difference between the means of the replicates. The alternative hypothesis proposed that there is a significant difference between the replicates</p>

<p>A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there was no significant difference among the ‚Äúts‚Äù categories. (ùëù > 0.01).Therefore, based on the available data, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which means there is no statistically significant difference among the ‚Äúts‚Äù categories.</p>
